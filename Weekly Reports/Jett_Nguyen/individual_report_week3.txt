1.
In total, from 1/24 to 1/30, I have spent around 15-20 hours on this project. I had a bit
more free time to dedicate than last week, so I spent most of that time developing the
wireframes for the app and integrating them into the project. This time also counts
meetings and housekeeping in GitHub and Jira.

I believe I spent the most time on the project out of the group for this week, as the rest of
the group’s responsibilities depend on my work. I am actively planning the next stages of
development once the wireframes/wireflow are completed.

I have continued to apply learning from HCI for this week. I am enjoying the process of
research on user-centered-design to ensure the target audience is reached and satisfied.
This comes from the combined interests in Computer Science and Public Relations,
which I’m glad I have found a niche in. The next process of implementing the wireframes
into code will come from experience in HCI and my current course in Internet
Programming.

I will say this is my first very thought-out and well-structured project that I have worked
on so far, considering we are paying lots of attention to planning and making sure
everything is set up correctly before proceeding. Getting this ingrained in my mind will
help me be prepared for life after college when I find work. Even if I don’t have a
technical role, the project process in general can be applied to any task I have.
